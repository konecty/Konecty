## Overview

Konecty's documentation was created to support developers and administrators in configuring, extending, and advanced use of the platform. The main topics cover:

- **Metadata**: How to define modules, fields, lists, dynamic views, and reports.
- **Permissions**: How to control user, group, and role access to different parts of the system.
- **Filters**: How to create advanced queries and segmentations for searches, reports, and automations.
- **Hooks**: How to customize and automate system behaviors using scripts executed at strategic points.
- **REST API**: How to authenticate, access, and manipulate data via REST endpoints.

Each section brings practical examples, property tables, and detailed explanations to facilitate the implementation and understanding of the features.
