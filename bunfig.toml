# Bun configuration. See https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/bunfig

[test]
# Preload: start MongoDB Memory Server and app before tests (same as Jest globalSetup).
preload = ["./__test__/bunSetup.ts"]
# Run Bun tests with: bun run test:bun (or bun test __test__ src)
# This limits discovery to __test__ and src so dist/ is not included.
# The build (babel) ignores *.test.* so dist/ does not contain test files.
