- REST API must be consistent and versioned
- Metadata and configuration must be dynamic and extensible (JSON Schema)

## Dependencies
- Node.js >= 18.x
- MongoDB >= 5.x
- Pino, Zod, Express, Yarn, Docker
- JSON Schema for metadata
- Additional open source libraries as needed for features and integrations
