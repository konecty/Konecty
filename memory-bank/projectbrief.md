# Project Brief

This document establishes the foundational knowledge base for the Konecty Server project, supporting collaborative development, process documentation, and continuous improvement.

## Purpose
Konecty Server is an open source platform designed to accelerate the creation of custom business systems. It provides ready-to-use authentication, role-based access control, a REST API with CRUD operations, and a relationship system between entities and collections. The platform is built with Node.js and MongoDB, leveraging a wide range of open source libraries and frameworks.

## Scope
- Deliver a modular, extensible server for business applications
- Provide core features: authentication, RBAC, RESTful CRUD, entity relationships
- Enable rapid development of custom modules and integrations
- Ensure robust documentation and developer onboarding
- Support dynamic process and decision documentation via the memory bank

## Requirements
- Node.js and MongoDB as primary technologies
- Clear, versioned, and up-to-date documentation (in English)
- Automated testing and CI/CD integration
- Secure, scalable, and maintainable architecture
- Community-driven, open source development model

## Out of Scope
- Client-side UI frameworks (handled by separate projects)
- Proprietary or closed-source modules
- Non-English documentation
