# Active Context

## Current focus
- **COMPLETED**: Task 1666 - Granular control for lists and pivots in the Konecty menu
- All implementation tasks completed successfully
- Ready to archive planning documents and move to next cycle

## Recent changes
- ✅ Successfully implemented `hideListsFromMenu` and `hidePivotsFromMenu` properties in MetaAccess schema
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for schema validation and filtering utilities
- ✅ Implemented filtering logic in `/rest/menu/list` endpoint with integration tests
- ✅ All tests passing with proper mocking and TDD approach
- ✅ Updated TASK.md to mark all tasks as completed

## Key learnings from this cycle
- TDD approach proved effective for schema changes and filtering logic
- Zod schema validation requires all required fields in test data (`fields: {}`, `fieldDefaults: {}`)
- Integration tests with proper mocking ensure end-to-end functionality
- Early return patterns and utility functions improve code maintainability
- Memory bank structure supports effective project tracking and knowledge retention

## Next steps
- Archive PLANNING.md and TASK.md to planning-bank
- Update memory bank with final learnings
- Prepare for next development cycle

## Active decisions and considerations
- All documentation maintained in English as per project standards
- Backward compatibility preserved with optional properties
- Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- Test coverage includes unit, integration, and schema validation tests
