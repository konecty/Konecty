# Product Context

## Why does this project exist?
Konecty Server exists to empower organizations and developers to rapidly build, deploy, and evolve custom business systems. It addresses the need for a flexible, open source backend that provides essential business features out-of-the-box, reducing time-to-market and technical debt.

## Problems it solves
- Complexity and cost of building business backends from scratch
- Lack of standardization in authentication, access control, and CRUD APIs
- Difficulty in managing relationships between business entities
- Onboarding and documentation gaps for new developers
- Need for extensibility, advanced filtering, and integration with other systems
- Need for business rules, automations, and event-driven workflows

## How it should work
- Provide a RESTful API for all core operations
- Support modular extension for custom business logic and automations
- Offer robust authentication and role-based access control
- Enable easy configuration of entity relationships and metadata (JSON Schema)
- Support advanced filtering and dynamic list views
- Enable event-driven integrations (queue/webhook)
- Ensure all documentation and process knowledge is dynamically updated in the memory bank

## User experience goals
- Fast onboarding for developers
- Clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date English documentation
- Intuitive API and configuration
- Reliable, secure, and scalable platform for business-critical applications
- Flexible enough to support custom business rules and automations
